IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool JavaFX Version 3.0   

IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool application lets you plan/subnet your assigned address for all 128 bits.
We are in the transition phase from IPv4 to IPv6 addressing structure, 
and I believe that the network engineers should easily plan their IPv6 
addressing /subnetting infrastructure without any error. In this 
article, I tried to explain how IPv6 subnetting works by giving 
examples. I also wrote and distributed a free IPv6 Subnetting Tool / 
Calculator both with C# and Java JDK 1.8 based on JavaFX Application 
Frameworks. It lets you plan/subnet your assigned address for all 
128bits. I distributed the applications in the hope that it will be 
useful for your subnet calculations. I will try to develop the software 
continuously, so please don't hesitate to comment/inform for any bugs or
 new feature suggestions.
